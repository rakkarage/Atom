# ca.HenrySoftware.Atom

Simple version of unity atoms for testings.

## Todo

- events on reference (healthChanged om Health) are not showing in inspector
  - try recreate objects
  - else make concrete serializable?
  - or base? idk it works in atoms?
- cannot pass value from event to unityEvent in handler? what is the int for then? useless!?
